üìå About This Project
This project demonstrates an AI/ML-based IoT sensor data validation pipeline, designed for early fault detection and degradation tracking in newly installed industrial sensors ‚Äî particularly within an energy production or asset-heavy environment.

The goal is to ensure data quality from new sensors by validating against historical behavior using a multi-model ensemble and surfacing results in a clear monitoring dashboard for operational decision-making.

üéØ Problem Statement
Newly deployed sensors may exhibit anomalies or faulty readings that can lead to inaccurate production reports ‚Äî potentially impacting compliance, forecasting, and asset performance monitoring.

This project simulates a realistic scenario where:

Data is ingested and enriched with trend-aware features (rolling mean, std, delta)

An ensemble of ML models (XGBoost, Autoencoder, Isolation Forest) classifies sensors as Normal or Faulty

Alerts and anomaly breakdowns are visualized using Power BI

‚öôÔ∏è Key Features
ETL pipeline in Python for data preprocessing, trend feature engineering, and model inference

Multi-model validation logic, using:

XGBoost residual analysis

Autoencoder reconstruction errors

Isolation Forest outlier scoring

Interactive Power BI dashboard for:

Real-time sensor status

Drift and deviation plots per feature

ML flag breakdown and filter

Designed for modular expansion across multiple sensor types and sites

üîß Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Autoencoder via Keras)

Power BI for visualization

Mock sensor data with labeled degradation scenarios

Designed to integrate with real-time ingestion layers (e.g., Kafka or REST endpoints)
